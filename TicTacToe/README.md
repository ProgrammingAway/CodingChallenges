## Tic Tac Toe Coding Challenge

I found this challenge at [Ryan’s Tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/programming-challenges/) which is a Tic Tac Toe game and states:

    Build a game of Tic Tac Toe. I would suggest you start off building a two player version then if you want a little extra challenge see if you can build a version where you get to challenge the computer.

I decided to do this challenge in Python since that is the language I’ve been using recently, but I do plan on attempting some challenges in different languages. I may also do some challenges in multiple languages. So, if you are looking for the complete python code for this challenge, it is located in the github repository. However, I suggest you try it by yourself first, and then come back to look at my solution.
